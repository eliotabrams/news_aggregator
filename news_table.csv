<p class=""wp-caption-text"">MoveOn is hiring organizers to defeat Trump. Apply before August 8.</p>
</div>
<p><span class=""c2"">Donald Trump is a dangerous bigot. And he’s tied in the polls in the battleground states that will decide the presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span class=""c2"">We will defeat Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton by recruiting, training, and supporting grassroots leaders in the communities that Trump has attacked.<br /></span></p>
<p><strong>This is an all hands on deck moment. That’s why we’re hiring state directors and field organizers in 10 battleground states to build a massive base of volunteer organizers.</strong> <strong>Check out the job descriptions below, and apply today for <a href=""http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffront.moveon.org%2Fmoveon-is-hiring-organizers-to-stop-trump-apply-now%2F%23statedirector"">state director</a> or <a href=""http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffront.moveon.org%2Fmoveon-is-hiring-organizers-to-stop-trump-apply-now%2F%23fieldorganizer"">field organizer</a>. </strong> (Or, share the opportunities using the share buttons to the right).</p>
<p>We will organize volunteer teams to knock on hundreds of thousands of doors and have conversations with enough voters to swing a close election–the presidential race, and, in many states, a Senate race, too. <span class=""c2"">We know that face-to-face conversations with voters are the #1 most effective way to increase voter participation.</span></p>
<p><span class=""c2"">With millions of members nationwide and an 18-year track record of winning electoral and progressive issue campaigns and breaking new digital and field organizing ground –and as the largest organization to endorse Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary–MoveOn is uniquely suited to influence the outcome of this election.</span></p>
<p><span class=""c2"">Unlike in most campaigns, we’re not running a paid canvass. We’re unleashing the phenomenal energy and smarts of volunteer leaders to canvass their own neighborhoods and communities, where they can make the biggest difference.</span></p>
<p><span class=""c2"">And we’re not stopping there. We know that our task is not just to win an election, but to demonstrate that bigotry is a losing strategy and to build power to win on the issues that matter to everyday people: income inequality, police and criminal justice reform, climate change, good jobs, immigrants’ rights, and more. Unlike candidate campaigns that shut down after Election Day, MoveOn.org organizes 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The leaders you develop will join a grassroots network that will organize to build power and win on issues after the election.</span></p>

<p><strong>MoveOn.org Political Action Executive Director Ilya Sheyman offered the following comment in advance of <span class=""aBn aQJ"" tabindex=""0"">tonight’s</span> Democratic National Convention speeches:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“<span class=""gmail-aBn gmail-aQJ"" tabindex=""0"">Tonight</span> voters across the country will hear from some of the leading progressive voices in the Democratic Party — Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. These voices – and their vision for a progressive America – have inspired millions of voters, helped create the most progressive party platform in Democratic history, and brought about real change at all levels of government. And tonight, they’ll come before thousands of delegates and millions of Americans to share the progressive vision for the country and help unite the Democratic Party around a common goal: to stand up against Donald Trump’s hate and division and ensure he never steps foot in the White House. MoveOn and our members are proud of the work we’ve done to advance the Sanders/Warren agenda, and <span class=""gmail-aBn gmail-aQJ"" tabindex=""0"">tonight’s</span> DNC program is a testament to the role progressives have played in shaping the Democratic Party. </em><em>The vision that Senators Warren and Sanders will share tonight — which Secretary Clinton has largely embraced — is not the future of the Democratic Party, it is the present and will be key to winning in November.”</em></p>

"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 14:50:01 +0000",Massive Door-to-Door Campaign Against Trump’s Hate-Filled Agenda Kicks Off in Ohio Ahead of RNC,"<div>


<p><span class=""c1""><em>Thousands of voters will pledge nationwide to vote against Trump; Effort will reach thousands of Ohioans and voters in 16 states this week.</em></span></p>
<p><strong>CLEVELAND</strong> – As Republicans prepare to nominate Donald Trump as their candidate for president, <strong>thousands of volunteers will embark on door-to-door canvasses in Ohio and 16 other states across the country this weekend asking voters to pledge to vote against hate and against Trump</strong>.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Ohioans are set to knock on thousands of doors beginning Saturday and continuing through the Republican National Convention as part of <strong>Ohio Against Hate</strong>, a local organizing effort coordinated by <strong>Ohio’s Good Jobs Strong Communities</strong> and <strong>MoveOn.org Political Action’s national United Against Hate</strong> effort to speak out and stand against Trump’s racist, hateful rhetoric and policies.</p>
<p>The door-to-door campaign will reach out to Ohioans from dozens of canvass locations, including in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Youngstown, Toledo, and Akron, among others.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Ohio Against Hate campaign, progressive organizations in 16 states and dozens of major cities are talking to voters on doorsteps this week as part of People’s Action’s National Doorstep Convention and similar efforts by the Center for Community Change Action.</p>
<p>“The National Doorstep Convention and Ohio Against Hate represent a historic push to expand the political revolution,” said <strong>MoveOn.org Campaign Director Victoria Kaplan</strong>. “Together we will combat the hatred and divisive politics of Trump, build multiracial support for economic and racial justice, and deepen grassroots democracy over corporate power.”</p>
<p>*** <strong>Interested in a local canvass?</strong> Email <a href=""http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=mailto%3Apress%40moveon.org"">press@moveon.org</a>. ***<br />*** <strong>See a copy of the pledge card Ohio voters will sign:</strong> <a href=""http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F29KwCLC"">http://bit.ly/29KwCLC</a> ***</p>
<p>The National Doorstep Convention door-to-door canvassing will also take place in: Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>“Ohioans reject Trump’s agenda, his hateful rhetoric and his effort to divide and malign what our country represents,” said <strong>Jerry Pena, Ohio Against Hate coordinator</strong>. “After the tremendous suffering Americans have endured in the past week and so many of the other challenges facing our country, we need someone whose leadership will heal and unite us, not a man like Trump who will wound and divide us. That’s the message we’ll be delivering this weekend to thousand of voters.”</p>
<p>The effort is bringing together local advocacy groups, progressive organizations, and leading voices.</p>
<p>“I joined the effort because I know Ohioans reject being divided by race, class, or religion,” said <strong>former Ohio State Senator Nina Turner</strong>. “On the eve of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, I am joining hundreds of volunteers to spread a message of hope and diversity, as opposed to the dark and cynical agenda Donald Trump is peddling.”</p>
<p>The nationwide canvassing effort builds on a growing coalition of progressive groups organizing major voter contact efforts to defeat Trump.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump’s candidacy is a threat to the America we love, and we must respond to him and what he is stoking as such—with a nonviolent movement grounded in love and community that ensures that he never comes anywhere near the White House, and perhaps even more importantly, makes clear to every other politician and every person in the United States that racist demagoguery is a dead-end political strategy that most Americans reject,” wrote progressive leaders in a <a href=""http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40MoveOn.org%2Fopen-letter-we-need-a-voting-renaissance-mass-nonviolent-mobilization-to-stand-up-to-trump-s-d065f2bd09cd"">five-alarm fire letter</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Ohio Against Hate is a project of Ohio’s Good Jobs Strong Communities and MoveOn.org Political Action that is uniting Ohioans to stand up to hate, bigotry, and division in our communities and at the voting booth.</p>
<p>MoveOn.org Political Action is running a multimillion-dollar United Against Hate campaign to keep the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, out of the White House and to ensure the country rejects his hateful and dangerous rhetoric.</p>

<p><strong>Statement from Ilya Sheyman, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action, on news that Donald Trump intends to pick Governor Mike Pence as his running mate:</strong></p>
<p class=""c1""><em>“If Trump picks extreme right-wing Governor Mike Pence as his running mate, he will be doubling down on his divisive and hate-filled approach to politics.</em></p>
<p class=""c1""><em>“Like Trump, Pence has a long record of trying to turn Americans against each other. As governor, Pence has pushed laws making it legal to discriminate against LGBTQ people, tried to keep nonprofits in his state from helping to resettle Syrian refugee families, and signed one of the worst laws in the country taking away women’s access to reproductive healthcare.</em></p>
<p class=""c1""><em>“Instead of uniting people, Pence has intentionally pitted his state’s communities against each other — he’s a divider, not a uniter, just like Trump, and that should be scary for all Americans.”</em></p>
